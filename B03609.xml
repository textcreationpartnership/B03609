            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ANd ye who are called Romane Catholicks, are the moſt dark and ignorant people, upon the face of the whole earth, that go under the names of Chriſtians, your whole worſhip is made up in the imagination and invention of the wiſdome of the fleſh, none ſo fooliſh but the naturall heathen, to bow to the works of mens hands, in which there is no life, as ye do, and for many of your Ceremonies, and Traditions, ye have no other foundation, but the naturall Heathen, as one of your own profeſsors doth confeſſe, as ye may read in the 587. Page of the Book called the Treaſury of the Romane Antiquities, where the Authour expreſſes many of your Cuſtomes and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes in your Religion, and is not aſhamed to ſay, ye borrowed them of the heathen; as that they hung their ſtreets with Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtry, and had reſting places in divers parts of the Towns, when they went in Proceſſion, as ye have at this day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that they carryed their images and reliques of their gods about, as ye do, and that they marched two and two together, carrying wax candles or Torches in their hands, and the ſame is obſerved in your Religion, and hath been ever ſince the Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was inſtituted.</p>
               <p>And that they went afoot as ye do and when they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with miſery, they went bare-foot, crying &amp; mourning ſtriving to appeaſe the wrath of their gods, and ye in the time of your great calamities do practiſe the ſame Ceremonies; they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained ſupplications and Lectures, that is, publick prayers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for more or leſs of dayes, and their Temples were full of calves, and their altars filled with offerings and all the holy places (as the Author terms them) were filled with people, kneeling and praying (to their Idols) to their gods, and ye have your Orizons of forty hours, your pardons and Jubilees, and obſerve the ſame Ceremonies, &amp; ſeveral other of the Cuſtoms and practiſes of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:183689:13"/>Heathen, this Authour declares of, and confeſſes they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame example; and practiſes the ſame in their Religion; which truly are ſuch fooliſh things, that they are not worth the mentioning; but of this I would have ye Roman Catholicks to take notice; the ſure foundation Chriſt Ieſus, is none of your example, in any of theſe things, nor your foundation, nor the Apoſtles, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians; for Ieſus Chriſt never practiſed, nor commanded, any ſuch things to be obſerved; therefore if it had not been confeſſed by one of your own profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, I had known the rice and foundation of theſe things; wherefore I ſay unto you view your foundation and be aſhamed, to take the name of Chriſtians, and build upon the Heathen, and have no other example for your Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and traditions, but the Heatheniſh Idolaters, own your name according to your nature and diſpoſition; for the true and Innocent Chriſtian followeth the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, and hath no other foundation, but the chief corner ſtone, the true light Chriſt which hath enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned every man that is come into the world, and who are built on this ſure foundation the rock of ages, denyes and witneſſes againſt all the Cuſtoms, Ceremonies, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh traditions of the Heatheniſh Idolaters, and cannot follow their example in any thing, but follow the true light Ieſus Chriſt, who gives his followers the light of life; ſo that in love to your ſouls, I deſire you to ceaſe from the cuſtoms of the Heathen, from your vain tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and fooliſh Ceremonies in which there is no life, and follow Ieſus Chriſt the everlaſting unchangeable high Prieſt, for in him is the life, he is the ſubſtance, the way, truth, and life, and in him is the ſalvation; but no ſalvation in your ceremonies and vain traditions; truly my ſoul pitties you, to ſee, how you are blinded and kept in ignorance from the knowledge of the truth, by the ſpirit of error, which hath long deceived the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and yet are highly conceited of your ſelves, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:183689:14"/>of your Religion; which is made up of fooliſh and vain imaginations and inventions of the old crooked Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who through his ſubtilty hath deteined and delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded your Fore-fathers in the time of Apoſtacy, and ſtill makes a prey upon you their ſucceſſours, who cryes up the antiquity of your Religion, as if the long continuance of it were ſufficient to prove it to be the true Religon, but then the lews, who pretend to be <hi>Moſes</hi> Diſciples may plead the antiquity of their Religion, who are of a longer ſtanding then ye, if antiquity were a ſufficient proof, and they have Scripture for their Temple-offerings and ſervices in the old Teſtament; but ye who pretend to be the Diſciples of Chriſt, have no Scripture in the new Teſtament for the upholding of your temple, daily ſervices, ceremonies and traditions; but all ſuch things teſtified againſt by the holy men, which gave the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture forth; ſo that the riſe and foundation of your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the imagination and invention of the ſenſuall wiſdome, from which wiſdome the ſecrets of God and the true Chriſtian Religion is hid; the Eternall God of power and infinit wiſdome, if it be his glorious will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your eyes, that ye may ſee the vanity of externall things, which ye feed upon; and bring you to ſerve him in the ſpirit, and to worſhip him in the truth, that you may no longer feed upon carnall imaginations and inventions, but upon the bread of life, the ſubſtance which is the immortall food, which refreſhes and nouriſheth the ſoul up to life eternall.</p>
               <p>And all ye forms of Religion under what name or title ſoever, who ſet up teachers amongſt you, and will not permit any to ſpeak in your Aſſemblies, but ſuch as ye in your own wills ſet up and appoint, ye are the people who heap to your ſelves teachers having Itching ears, ye are out of the order of the Church in God, where all the members have liberty to ſpeak one by one; in the diſorder and cofuſion, which makes you manifeſt to

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:183689:15"/>of God, ſpeak to the Prieſt, or a word of exhortation to the people, then cryes out both Prieſt and people haile him away, or words to that purpoſe, and calls it diſturbance, (to performe the will of the Lord) and goes to the Magiſtrates for aſſiſtance, and cryes away with him, ſend him to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or puniſh him, this is the practiſe of the carnall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours who uphold the externall Temple and Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, therefore view your diſorder and be aſhamed of ſuch groſs and filthy practiſes; for ye Rulers, Prieſts and people in <hi>England,</hi> in theſe late years have outſtript the Heathen in many ages, in your cruell perſecution; which makes the hearts of the righteous ſad, to ſee ſuch fruits brought forth in the Nation, where ſo much liberty in words and writings is proclaimed for Religion, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt hearted people, by the ſupream in authority; but woe, woe, from the Almighty unto you, who make the hearts of the innocent ſad, which God hath not made ſad, a day of torment, and miſery is coming upon you; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the righteous ſhall be glad, which ye have made ſad, and over the ſmoke of your torment, they ſhal rejoyce, Did ever the Primitive Chriſtians recorded in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, perſecute any priſon, whip, burn with hot Irons, or caſt into Dungeons any ſort of people, that came into their Aſſemblies, is not the Heathen your example, for theſe things, who perſecuted and ſhamefully entreated and murdered the Chriſtians, who could not ſubmit to their unrighteous decrees and unreaſonable wills, ſhew one example of cruelty if you can, from the practiſe of Chriſt or his Diſciples, if not, number your ſelves amongſt the Heathen your example for your cruell perſecution; is not cruelty and perſecution, a true marke to know the Synagogue of Satan by; from the body of Chriſt the Church in God? who in all ages hath ſuffered, but never perſecuted any, but prayed for their enemies which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
